# Contract Agreement

Between me [company name]
and you [customer name]

## Summary:

I'll always do my best to fulfill your needs and meet your expectations, but it's important to have things written down so that we both know what's what, who should do what and when, and what will happen if something goes wrong. In this contract you won't find any complicated legal terms or long passages of unreadable text. I've no desire to trick you into signing something that you might later regret. What I do want is what's best for both parties, now and in the future.

So in short;

You ([customer name]), located at [customer address] are hiring us ([company name]) located at [company address] to [design and develop a web site] for the estimated total price of [total] as outlined in our previous correspondence. Of course it’s a little more complicated, but we’ll get to that.

## What do both parties agree to do?

*You:* You have the authority to enter into this contract on behalf of yourself, your company or your organization. You'll give me everything I need to complete the project as and when and in the format I need it. You'll review my work, provide feedback and approval in a timely manner too. Deadlines work two ways, so you'll also be bound by dates we set together. You also agree to stick to the payment schedule set out at the end of this contract.

*Me:* I have the experience and ability to do everything we've agreed with you and I'll do it all in a professional and timely manner. I'll endeavor to meet every deadline that's set and on top of that I'll maintain the confidentiality of everything you give me.

##Contracted Hourly Rate

By signing this contract I ([customer name]) agree and understand that the regular contracted hourly rate will be set at ([hourly rate]) per hour for any and all work billed by ([company name])



### Content & Design

You understand that I am not a designer and will not design your project. You must provide a design criteria for the project if it applies including any photoshop designs, wireframe mockups, or final design specifications. I can and will however code every part of this scope of work for your project to perfection based on the design work provided.

You’ll have two or more weekly opportunities to review my work and provide feedback. If, at any stage, you’re not happy with the direction my work is taking, you’ll pay me in full for everything I’ve produced until that point and cancel this contract.

#### Text content

Unless specified in the attached scope of work I'm not responsible for writing or inputting any text copy, images, etc.


#### Photographs

You should supply graphic files in an editable, vector digital format. You should supply photographs in a high resolution digital format. Whether you choose to buy stock images/photographs or use your own, I cannot take any responsibility for their usage, legal issues, or violations they might cause.

### Development

#### Delivery
I deliver high quality code developed using the latest standards at the time of production and I try my best to meet the deadlines necessary to deliver on-time. You have several different options of delivery which can be any of the following:

1. Granted access to the git repository.
2. Deployment to your live server. (extra fees may apply)
3. In a compressed downloadable file.

*If any of those options are unacceptable it must be specified otherwise.*

#### Code Ownership

You understand that unless otherwise specified in this contract or attached documents all code produced by me will default to using the GNU General Public License. If you have specific questions about the GNU license refer to their website ( [http://www.gnu.org](http://www.gnu.org) )for further reading.

#### Software Training

You understand that training, tutoring, & instruction in the software produced by me or any other software is not part of this agreement unless specified in "additional services" and that a separate estimate would have to be provided for that service.

#### Security and data loss or corruption
You understand that I will not be held liable for any data loss or corruption whether intentional or unintentional at any time. I also will not take any responsibility or can guarantee that your site and it's data is protected against security flaws or programming errors. It is your responsibility to ensure that you maintain secure backups of all of your data and files to protect yourself in case of any loss. Furthermore I will not be held liable for any damages or costs associated and you waive your right to prosecute.

#### Testing

Testing no longer means attempting to make a website look the same in browsers of different capabilities or on devices with different size screens. It does mean ensuring that a person's experience of a design should be appropriate to the capabilities of a browser or device. It also means writing automated tests that push the limits of your codebase to produce the desired results.


##### Desktop browser testing

I test my work in current versions of major desktop browsers including those made by Apple (Safari), Google (Chrome), Microsoft Internet Explorer, Mozilla Firefox and Opera I won't test in other older browsers unless you specify otherwise. **If you need an enhanced design for an older browser, I can provide a separate estimate for that.**

##### Mobile browser testing

Testing popular small-screen devices is essential in ensuring that a person's experience of a design is appropriate to the capabilities of the device they're using. I test my work in:</p>

1. iOS
⋅⋅* Safari
⋅⋅* Google Chrome
⋅⋅* Opera Mini
2. Android
⋅⋅* Google Chrome
⋅⋅* Opera Mini

I currently don't test Blackberry OS or Blackberry QNX, Opera Mobile, Symbian or other mobile browsers. If you need me to test using these, I can provide a separate estimate for that.

### Discovery

Discovery is where we really work out the minor details of the project planning out what needs to be done, what technologies to use, and how long each milestone will take to complete. You understand that the initial discovery is limited before the project actually begins. You also understand that once the project is underway and the actual discovery has begun that the project estimate can change considerably from what the estimated cost was.

### Changes & Revisions

I know from experience that fixed-price contracts are rarely beneficial to you, as they often limit you to your earliest ideas. As the project evolves and you come up with new ideas I don't want to limit your ability to change your mind. The estimated cost at the beginning of this contract is based on the length of time I estimate for the enclosed *scope of work*. If that is exceedingly different from the enclosed *scope of work* we will need to create an additional scope of work and attach it to this contract or negotiate a new one.

**I'm happy to be flexible, if you want to change your mind or add anything new, that won't be a problem as I'll provide a separate estimate for that.**

### Support

#### Technical support

I'm not a tech support hotline so I don't offer 24-7 support for the software I've written or any other computer related issues such as hosting & email configuration, or general computer problems. If your in need of such services or need additional support then it must be enclosed in the attached *scope of work*.

#### Emergency Support

Sometimes things go seriously wrong, and you need them fixed seriously fast. So, you might need what I call "Emergency Support" which comes in three varieties. Each providing an average response time NOT excluding holidays or weekends, meaning I will respond to the problem within that time period. The rate will also vary depending on what level of emergency support is needed and the rate will be calculated by the regular contracted rate contained within this contract. Which means if something breaks I'm on call for you 24-7 if you are in dire need of it. Emergency services work just like 911! You call me, specify the emergency, and what level of care it's in need of and I will come rushing to your aid.

**Response time within:**
1. 12-24 hours **@** *3x* the regular contracted hourly rate
2. 24-48 hours **@** *2x* the regular contracted hourly rate
3. 3-5 days **@** *1.5x* the regular contracted hourly rate


#### Retainer Fees

You choose to accept a retainer fee? **Yes** or **No**

If you marked **Yes** above you agree that you would like to retain ([hours retained]) contract hours per month for a fee of ([retainer fee]) on an ongoing basis until ([retainer end date]). You understand that this retainer fee is not transferrable, non-refundable, does not accumulate, and is on a per month basis. You will be designated the set amount of hours per month for whatever expertise you might need for the regular contracted hourly rate. You understand that by hiring me on a retainer basis you are not guaranteed a designated time period in which I can work on your projects.

#### Project Progression

You take on the responsibility of moving the project forward. Meaning if I am delivering code, your doing reviews and pushing the project forward. Failure to communicate on the project within two weeks time without prior notice will be billed in full and delivered in it's current state whatever that may be with no guarantee of completing the project. You also agree to pay the bill in full within 30 days time. If you don't get back to us within 30 days then any penalty fees will also be added and expected to be paid in full.

#### Single Point Of Contact

You agree and understand that there will be one single point of contact between me and ([customer name]) for the entire duration of this project. They will relay all  the project decisions and communication through to me on a regular basis in accordance with the project progression as outlined in this contract. If that should change at anytime you must inform me of this change.

**That single point of contact will be:**

([contact name])
([contact email])
([contact phone])
([contact address])


### Billing & Payments

I'm sure you understand how important it is as a small business that you pay the invoices that I send you promptly. As I'm also sure you'll want to stay friends, you agree to stick to getting me paid on the 1st & 15th of every month for any and all dues owed for that billing cycle.


*Failure to make payments on time as per the above payment schedule will be subject to a 30% interest penalty on the balance of that billing cycle.*

#### Deposit

You agree that before any work is to ensue you will provide an earnest money deposit of ([deposit amount]), non-refundable which will be applied towards your billing last statement.

#### Cancellation

You'll have two or more weekly opportunities to review my work and provide feedback. If, at any stage, you're not happy with the direction my work is taking, you'll pay me in full for everything I've produced until that point and cancel this contract.

### Legal Stuff

I can't guarantee that my work will be error-free and so I can't be liable to you or any third-party for damages, including lost profits, lost savings or other incidental, consequential or special damages, even if you've advised us of them. Finally, if any provision of this contract shall be unlawful, void, or for any reason unenforceable, then that provision shall be deemed severable from this contract and shall not affect the validity and enforceability of any remaining provisions.

#### Copyrights

First, you guarantee that all elements of text, images or other artwork you provide are either owned by your good selves, or that you've permission to use them.

Then, when your final payment has cleared, copyright will be automatically assigned as follows:

You'll own the elements that I create for this project. I'll give you source files and finished files and you should keep them somewhere safe as I'm not required to keep a copy. You own all elements of text, images and data you provided, unless someone else owns them.

I'll own the unique combination of these elements that constitutes a complete design and I'll license that you, exclusively and in perpetuity for this project only, unless we agree otherwise. I can provide a separate estimate for that.

I love to show off my work and share what I've learned with other people, so I reserve the right, with your permission, to display and link to your project as part of my portfolio and to write about it on websites, magazine articles, and in books as well as any other multimedia avenue such as film, podcasts, or radio broadcasts.

### But where's all the horrible small print?


Just like a parking ticket, you can't transfer this contract to anyone else without our permission. This contract stays in place and need not be renewed. If for some reason one part of this contract becomes invalid or unenforceable, the remaining parts of it remain in place.

Although the language is simple, the intentions are serious and this contract is a legal document under exclusive jurisdiction of the US court system.
